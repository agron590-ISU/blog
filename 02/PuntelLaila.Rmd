## Rules for care and Feeding the Data:


I am most likely to follow rule number #1 "Love Your Data, and Help Others Love It, Too". Loving what you do and the data you collect, is in my opinion the primary source of motivation to produce high quality data and be able to share it with others. Data sharing allows for the replicability of experimental findings and allow for reuse in new and unexpected ways. Sharing your data could enhance the impact of your research. Better to fall in love with you data from the first moment and use all the available resources to keep it that relationship strong!

There are several rules that I think may never follow. like rule #2, #4, #5, #6, and even #8! Of course that was all part of the past because I am actively learning all the data stewardship skills out of this class to follow those rules from now on.yay!

Which rule would you really like to follow, but know deep down that you will fail? Why? I am really focus on trying to "Conduct Science with a Particular Level of Reuse in Mind", rule #3. I think that having been working with other people's data made me realize how important it is to consider what level of reuse you expect from your data and I have been trying to plan accordingly. However, I think the adoption of all available tools to enable data reuse like e.g: consider adopting standard formats and metadata standards, keep careful track of versions of data and code, with associated dates, etc need to be more disseminated to increase the adoption and facilitate the workflow between colleagues.
