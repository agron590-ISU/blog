1. Which rule are you most likely to follow and why?  
2. Which rule do you think you may never follow and why?  
3. Which rule would you really like to follow, but know deep down that you will fail? Why?

## Instructions:
Copy and save a **new copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and leaving the original unedited.
