## Feeding Data

Thoughts on this article: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003542

1. Which rule are you most likely to follow and why? 

  Rule 5 or 6, given the data intensive nature of the genomic component of my lab's analyses these two rules seem most applicable and useful. From my perspective, as a new researcher, I often find figures generated in paper from code, that would be really useful to see/re-create. 
  
2. Which rule do you think you may never follow and why?  

  I would like to think that I could/would follow all of the rules presented, I mean, it's in Nature for goodness sake. However, rule 7 seems to be the least important in my eyes. On some level credit is great, in the big picture, for me, not so much. 

3. Which rule would you really like to follow, but know deep down that you will fail? Why?

  Rule 4, context. I can already see that this rule would be something that I really have to work on. I can see that in my current lab notes, initial notes are often very detailed... but as time goes on in an experiment, they become less so. I believe as I move into an experiment, the details become more and more familiar and then less relevant in the moment. It will be important to stay conscious of this, as context could be crucial in re-creating data.
