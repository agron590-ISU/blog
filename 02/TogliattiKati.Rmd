## Blog 2:

1. Which rule are you most likely to follow and why?  
  I am most likely to follow rule number 1 "love your data, and help others love it, too". This is because I would like to get my data published and once it is published make it available to others to use. This is important because scientists after me will be able to build on my work and improve methods. 
  
2. Which rule do you think you may never follow and why?
  I think that I may never follow rule number 6 "publish your code (even the small bits)". My code is very inefficient and messy and I would be embarassed for others to see it. 

3. Which rule would you really like to follow, but know deep down that you will fail? Why?
  Rule number 5 "link your data to your publications as often as possible" seems like something that I would like to follow but will fail at. I am uneasy about sharing data before it is published because someone could copy and take the data.
