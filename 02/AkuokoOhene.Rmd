## Question #1
Rule #10
I would most likely follow  this rule because I am just learning the importance of good datastewardship and  am a product of someone tinforming me of the value and importance of proper data collection and also stewardship. Understanding its value and importance not only to your own current work but your future work, as well as colleagues work is something that I believe should be expressed more in the scientific community early on.


## Question #2
Rule 5:
I dont think it would be an issue linking most of my data, tables, charts or graphs to my p aublications asoften as possible but I dont believe that I would be publishing all of my ecific code and databases just yet. A situation would be if I was towards the genesis of a project and would stil want to do some work to make more conclusive findings before I publish further.

## Question #3
Rule #7
This rule seems to be just a step above the rules 6 and rules 2. I believe I would want to incorporate this method in publications but I think that in some cases it would be unneccessary, especially if I already had a permanent identifier, such as a doi or a link citing all of the data or code back to me already.
