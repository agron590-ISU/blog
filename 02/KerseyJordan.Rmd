1. I believe I am most likely to follow rule 3- conducting science with reuse in mind, most frequently.  I get really frustrated with myself because I will save things quickly, labeled as something which, beyond the moment of saving, I cannot decipher the meaning of.  There have been instances in which I have completely gone through my files and renamed everything to fit a better, more descriptive system.  Therefore, I believe that if I start now, and keep this in mind, my vision of an extremely reliable, and organized- for later use- file conglomeration could become reality!

2. I find rule 6 to be the one that I will likely never follow up on.  I like the idea of publishing my work frequently, but I do not see it happening.  Perhaps it's rooted in my lack of confidence in my coding, and organization of data, or perhaps I am just too lazy to consistently post, but I just do not see this becoming a habit of mine.

3. Rule 4 is like a dream for me!  I love the idea of having my process so organized as to be coded, in detail, but I know this is going to take a lot of dedication to actually prevail.  If I could ensure I could spend ample time doing all of my work with data, as to slow down enough to document each and every step, than this would be no problem.  But, as reality is not my dream world, I know I will struggle with this, immensely.
