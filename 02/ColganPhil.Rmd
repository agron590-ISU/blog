I think the rules laid out in "Ten Simple Rules for the Care and Feeding of Scientific Data" can be broken up into 3 general categories; specific data management practices for reproducibility in personal projects and collaborations, advocacy for open source data, and advocacy for the art of data management as a profession. I am most likely to follow rule 3 because for the amount of data i work with, my success depends on it. Following through with rules 4 and 6, publishing my pipeline and code, comes naturally after that because i will have documented and laid out the everything for my future sanity and for my collaborators. I really dont think there are any rules in this list that would be too hard to follow, i support all of them. I think the hardest one for me to follow will be rule 3 because its kind of a loaded rule with many facets, luckily i have AGRON 590 to tell me all about it this semester.
