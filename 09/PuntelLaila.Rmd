From this chapter "The Grammar of Graphics" =="GOG" by Wilkinson we learnt that there are mainly three purposes of grammar in graphics:

?         Perform statistics on them: In a way that are flexible enough for the user

?         Keep track of the actions to generate a graph: This is great advantage so ensures that everybody can output the graph. Allowing repeatability of the data graphing.   

?         Have a user interactive way so ordinary people can understand the graphics

The author cover also the seven orthogonal component of the GOG:
?         Variables

?         Algebra

?         Scales

?         Statistics

?         Geometry

?         Coordinates

?         Aesthetics


According to the author of the challenge could be the necesity to have orthogonal components, that could lead into a large variability of graphs as a consequence of the large flexibility and detail in the code ("undiscovered"). This will requiere interpretations from the user to get the actual desirable graphs. 
We have been using and learning about GOG through the R package Ggplot2 to reproduce graphs on data that has been previously standardize and transform in tidy format.
