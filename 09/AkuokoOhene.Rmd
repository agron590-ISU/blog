Through reading the article it seems as though the purpose of GOG is to first develop a viable way to graph and visualize data for statisticains and non statistians alilke, all while encouraging a tidy environment to do so. A few other purposes of the GOG is to better understand and adhere to the steps it takes to develop proper visualizations,while also developing a more effecient and less human reliable system for data upkeep.

The chapter didn't really speak too much on the challanges or cons of certain grammars. But through my limited experience and what we've learned thus far, some challenes in grammar use may lie in its dependancy on the chronological order that the chart based process must undertake. There is a required order of operations to perform and complete the visualiztion process and if one the verbs are out of order or missing it could cause errors in the data.

We have covered similar concepts and principles of GOG a number of times in this course. GOG operates a lot like SQL and even has similar operateable functions when it comes to organizing and analyzing the data. First, in order to operate the data must be ordered and in a relational database.

There are three main verbs used that show some correlation to what we have covered in class. The cross join seems to be very similar to the "joins" idea in SQL specifically the left join technique. Nests concept of GOG seems to be more related to the "group by" and The blending technique which lenghtens a data set is more closely related to the Union as it combines variables of similar units but in the same columns.
GOG like SQL also allows you to update and manipulate data without distrupting or destroying or losing data.
