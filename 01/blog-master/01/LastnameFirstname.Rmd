## Prompt:

Talk about your worst experience with data. Try to think about what made this experience stand out in your mind and why it was so difficult. If you could have changed one or two things about the situation, what would you prioritize?

## Instructions:
Save a **new copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and leaving the original unedited.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the Prompt and Instructions sections and write your blog post!
