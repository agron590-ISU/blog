My worst data experience was when I was at Colorado State University for the summer completing my REU. We were put into partners at the begninning of this internship. Towards the end of the project, my partner had deleted a good portion of our scripts (which were not properly backed up) as well as our data 3 weeks before we were going to preset. We were trying to redownload 2 years worth of NEXRAD data from the NCDC webpage and broke the website. The website was down for about 2 and 1/2 weeks. We only had half a week to get all of our scripts up and running with the data before we were supposed to present. We were not able to get all 2 years worth of data analyzed and had to cut it down to 3 months. This was by far my worst data experience.
