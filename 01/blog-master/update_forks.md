# Instructions for setting up a fork with the upstream

This is how we set up our forks to be able to *pull* changes from the upstream parent remote repo. We need to do this in order to keep our blog (and lab and homework) forks up to date with new assignments.

## To setup

1. Open your forked repo in SourceTree
2. Select **Repository > Repository Settings**
3. In the **Remotes** pane press **Add**
4. Enter the name `upstream` and the URL/path to the parent Repo
	* This can be found in the parent repo under **clone or download**
5. Press OK, then Ok.

## To update

1. Select **Pull** in the toolbar.
2. In the "Pull from repository" dropdown, switch from your fork to the repo you just added
3. Press OK
4. (Optional) push any new content up to your fork repo on GitHub.
