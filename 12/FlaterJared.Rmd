Wow, last blog post! And a great article to go with it, I think it really wraps up what we have learned in this class. The class has led us to a path, one that is about reproducablity and collaboration. In that respect, two great tools to facilitate this are: Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown. 

These two tools both provide us with a template for creating, for example, walk thgroughs. From what I can tell, there is a lot of similarity between the two. Both accept different languages in code chunks, both can be "knit" to different formats for sharing. 

By this point in the class, by familiarity with R has surpassed that for my Python...so I naturally gravitate towards R...however, I'm going to make it a point to start a new Jupyter notebook for my next project to see what that is all about.
