## Blog 12:

*Nature* is a very high impact journal that has a lot of people that read it. With a journal of such high impact publishing articles about the use of dynamic documents, it is showing that perhaps this is something scientists should be working towards. I believe it will take a new generation of scientists to make dynamic documents a regular occurrence in published literature. Many scientists are set in their ways of how data should be published and what types of documents should be used to make those publications. Shifting towards using dynamic documents and other resources that can help streamline the analysis and writing of publications will be a big jump in how scientists communicate.
