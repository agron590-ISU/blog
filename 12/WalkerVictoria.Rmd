Does Nature allow for the publishing of interactive notebooks or are they merely publishing an article about the practice? I don't think I've read a paper in my field that had an accompanying dynamic document -- I just email the corresponding author when I need help. I think that dynamic documents would need to be mandatory before becoming commonplace as few people are willing to upend their workflow to do something new.
