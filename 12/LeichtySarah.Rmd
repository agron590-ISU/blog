## Helen Shen's "Interactive notebooks":

Helen Shen articulates the benefits of utilizing interactive notebooks such as IPython in order to make code more accessible to the author and others who would like to replicate the work. I was surprised but excited that this article was published in a reprudiable journal such as Nature. In my field of environmental science, Nature is held at a high level that few scientists are able to reach in order to publishing scientific research. This publication indicates that this new technology is revolutionizing research. In order to go mainstream, more journals such as Nature should publish its advantages so that scientists are aware of its purpose and real benefits. The more journals can hype up this new tool, the more people will look into it and contribute to its adoption. This is an exciting time to be interested in research; with so many diverse tools aimed at making research a collaborative, innovative practice instead of a stuffy, individual activity, I can't wait to become a part of this developing community.
