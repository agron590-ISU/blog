## Blog #12:

For this week's blog, we read Helen Shen's article ["Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code"](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261). I found it fascinating that an article like this was published in a credible journal with an outstanding reputation. I have read many articles from Nature since they relate to my field of Agricultural Meteorology. By Shen publishing her article in Nature, many scientists and researchers will be most likely read this and get involved. She is spreading the word in a very efficient way. I could see reproducibility and dynamic documents going mainstream as long as everyone is getting educated about it. By people like Helen, a story out to the public is the first step. Once scientists see how others are using dynamic documents and being efficient and successful with their work, I think it will only be a matter of time before everyone is following this trend.
