1. This is a major for the advancement of reproucible research. Nature is one of the most known and respected journals in the scientific commmunity, so the  things in which are published withi carry alot of weight in terms of its  validity and feasability.

The examples used are in the article very much so make the case for atleast the thought of attempting to utilize the concept in a curious scientists' own research. The examples of those who have used this code and have found success are scientist using very complicated,large and difficult to handle datasets and are receiving huge divedends in the amount of success in the data wrangling and communication process, not only with publishing and reviewing, but within their own groups. I think that testimonies like these in a journal like nature will atleast spark a strong interest in scientist within similar situations.


2. To go mainstream like many great ideas, a mixture of time, proper training in programming and the increase of success stories like the ones mentioned in the article. Along with order, organiation ease in comprhension, reproducibility solves a major problem that plagues many scienist, which is time spent in data anlysis process. I believe that as "word of mouth" increases and in this increasingly technological world, scientist begin to break away and be more comfortable with "relatively" simpler forms of programming it will reach the its proper heights. Though it will take time, I think reproducible documenting will be a think of the future.
