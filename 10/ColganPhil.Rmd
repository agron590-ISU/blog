The paper by Robert Gentleman and Duncan Lang titled "Statistical Analyses and Reproducible Research" describes dynamic documents used for facilitating reproducible research and aiding in collaborations. The way i understand it is that a workflow can incorporate many different programming languages and packages and dynamic documents are a way to centralize and consolidate all of that code and ouput into a single document that can be shared to make learning and sharing data analysis pipelines easier. The document can be modified with code to cater to different audiences that will use it for different things. For example, the document can be modified easily to remove code that someone might not need to see, but still show the graphs it outputs.
